# Development Planning

## Purpose
This rule ensures systematic planning and validation for all new development or changes.

## Instructions
- MUST create an AI-readable plan first using ultrathink for any new development, feature additions, or significant changes. (ID: CREATE_PLAN)
- MUST structure the plan with discrete, measurable steps that can be validated independently before proceeding to the next step. (ID: DISCRETE_STEPS)
- MUST obtain explicit approval of the plan before beginning execution. (ID: PLAN_APPROVAL)
- MUST include architectural diagrams, flowcharts, or visual representations if the work involves complex system interactions or workflows. (ID: INCLUDE_DIAGRAMS)

## Priority
Critical

## Error Handling
- If ultrathink is not available, create structured plan with clear validation points and document the limitation
- If diagram tools are not available, use text-based descriptions and document the visual limitation
