# Version Control

## Purpose
This rule ensures consistent version control practices and commit standards.

## Instructions
- MUST write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain both what changed and why the change was made, following conventional commit format when possible. (ID: COMMIT_MESSAGES)
- MUST commit all changes with an appropriate descriptive commit message when user mentions "checkpointing the work" or similar checkpoint requests. (ID: CHECKPOINT_COMMIT)

## Priority
Medium

## Error Handling
- If commit message format is inconsistent with existing patterns, follow existing patterns and note inconsistency
