# Cost Estimation

## Purpose
This rule ensures cost analysis is performed for all proposed infrastructure resources.

## Instructions
- MUST generate detailed cost estimates for any proposed resources including both static costs (fixed monthly charges) and dynamic costs (usage-based charges) with realistic usage examples and scenarios. (ID: COST_ESTIMATES)
- MUST use web resources, AWS Pricing Calculator, or available MCP tools for accurate cost estimation when dedicated cost estimation MCP is not available. (ID: WEB_COST_RESOURCES)

## Priority
Medium

## Error Handling
- If cost estimation tools are not available, provide general cost guidance and recommend manual calculation
- If dynamic cost examples cannot be determined, focus on static costs and document the limitation
