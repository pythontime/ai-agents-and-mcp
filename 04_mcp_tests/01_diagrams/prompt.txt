Design an AWS three-tier architecture that consists of the following:
1) a layer 7 load balancer with a secure listener
2) application runtime using node.js in auto-scaled Docker containers
3) a highly available postgres database
Use cloud-native architecture principles, and when finished, generate a visualization using the aws official icon set. The diagram should be detailed and account for the AWS features in use.
