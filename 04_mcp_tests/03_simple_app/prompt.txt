Generate an application according to the following specifications:
1) read the rules in ~/.aws/amazonq/rules/ (all files in the directory structure) and use them for this conversation
2) the app runs in the current directory, listening on port 8080
3) the app uses the static diffusion model to generate images from a prompt, stored in ./model/
4) before downloading any model, check the ./model/ directory to see if there is a previous cached copy
5) ensure the app can use the local GPU
6) the app has a well-designed web front end with many parameters that can be customized using the form
7) while generating images, leave any previously generated images on the page during generation
8) provide an option to download generated images
9) use the front-end mcp to identify and follow best practices
10) test the application programmatically at each step to validate functionality
