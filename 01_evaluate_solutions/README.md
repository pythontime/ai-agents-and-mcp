1. REST API endpoint generation with validation
2. Security vulnerability analysis
3. Legacy code refactoring to modern patterns

### Part B: Amazon Q for DevOps
1. Complete Terraform infrastructure generation
2. Deployment automation script creation
3. CI/CD pipeline troubleshooting and fixes

## Materials Needed
- Terminal windows for both agents
- Code editor to show outputs
- Legacy app prepared with intentional issues
- Broken GitHub Actions workflow file
